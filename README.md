U know -  Just beginning

I started learning coding at end of 2017..
Learnt about Linux with RaspbPi as gift
Since than dug into Python, HTML, and many Linux distros..
Prefer Mint, but found a few I liked well enough.

I would like to begin JavaScript, JS node, or maybe Android Studio..
But as of now Im here, in hopes to contribute to something I seen.
Or simply step out of my box, and gather info from whomever..
